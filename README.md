GAMER is a community-centered DeFi project by everyone, for everyone. The decisions and actions of GAMER are made by its members and community to assure equity and fairness for all. GAMER is a new form of governance system. A think-pump. A place where innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological advancements are the priority, creating a much needed utility focus to the blockchain space. The value of GAMER is determined by the contribution and innovation of the community as a whole.

## A rectified rebased Protocol

GAMER is an brand-new experimental protocol on programmable money and governance. Its mechanism comes from Ampleforth and YAM and surpass them. Ampleforth made breaking-through innovation by introducing rebase mechanism, however it lacks for something leading to a sprial down. As we all know, YAM is combination of YFI and Ampleforth with the exciting design of treasury. But YAM is suffering from tremendous uncertainty, Yamv3 still need to be examined. We saw the value and innovation from both and we came up with an evolution---GAMER.FINANCE.

* A governable treasury to further support stability;

* Fully on-chain governance to enable decentralized control and evolution from Day 1;

* A fair distribution mechanism that incentivizes key community members to actively take the reins of governance;

* Community expansion incentive --- TeamPool (or what we named it DAO-booster);

## Treasury Pool

**Function**: to serve as a price buffer when Gamer goes down or what we call negative bebase.

**Mining Rules**: Deposit Gamer to earn DAI and claim or withdraw at you ease.

* Treasury Pool will launch at the time of first rebase;

* Every 10% of DAI in reserve will be released to treasury pool for each negative rebase;

* Users just need to stake Gamer in Treasury Pool to claim DAI;

**Point**: Compared to Yamv3, Gamer provides a much more smart and convincing mechanism to feedback negative rebase.

## The Future

The future will be entirely controlled by the community of GAMER holders. Again, gamer holds zero inherent value; any value which might accrue would be an entirely emergent property of the community that takes control. This community of GAMER holders will determine and update the functionality of the GAMER protocol, including oracle usage, rebase functionality, inflation, incentive design, the GAMER treasury, and more. While the treasury begins empty with potential growth configured to be denominated in DAI, any future capital allocation can ultimately be controlled by GAMER token holders, as can any yield that it might generate. In theory, it is possible that such a treasury could add robustness and security to the protocol, if properly cultivated by GAMER holders. The following are what will happen with the launch of GAMER protocol.
